Algoritms

sorting:
- bubble sort
- recursion - selection
- merge sort - divide into 2 halves, sort halves, merge and compare halves
-


- linear search
- selection sort
-

structs -
typedef struct
{
    string name;
    int votes;
}
candidate;


linear search -> from 1st element, step over each element of the array
binary search -> algo to find element -> reduce size of search array by 2 if array is sorted, repeat it until array size is 0:
    - calculate middle point, if middle point is less than search element go right, if bigger - 0 to middle point
    - left from the middle
    - from middle to the right
buble sort -> move higher value to the end with swap counter
selection sort -> swap smallest value in array to the beginning, find in unsorted part of array for smallest element
recursion -> function that calls itself, collatze conjucture
merge sort -> divide array into smaller array and sort and combine, sort halves
